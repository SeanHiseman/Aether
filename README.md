This is a community social media site, where users post video, image or text content either to their own profile or to groups. 

Each post has upvotes and downvotes as well as a reply section. Each user has a limit of 10 up or down votes per post, since each piece of content can be voted on multiple times. Everyone has content feeds with posts from their followed users and groups, as well as recommended content. Each user has friends and followers, as well as a private profile (only visible to friends) and a public profile (visible to everyone). Profiles can have many different channels where content is posted, with all posts aggregated together in the main feed.

Groups also consist of channels, including a main channel, each containing a section for posts and chats. Groups themselves can be part of larger groups in a nested structure. 

Users can chat privately with their friends or publicly in groups. Multiple chats can be made between the same users.

Edit databaseSetup.js with your local MySQL connection details to run. Requires Node.js and Express.js to be already installed.
