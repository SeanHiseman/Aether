This is a community social media site, where users post video, image or text content either to their own profile or to groups. 

Each post has likes and dislikes as well as a comment section. Each user has a limited number of likes/dislikes per day, and each piece of content can be liked/disliked multiple times. Everyone has a curated content feed with posts from their followed users and groups, as well as recommended content. Each user has friends and followers, as well as a private profile (only visible to friends) and a public profile (visible to everyone). Groups themselves can be part of larger groups in a nested structure. Users can chat privately with their friends or publicly in groups.

Currently contains a small content database for testing, this is temporary.

Still very early on so lots of features to add and bugs to fix!
