This is a community social media site, where users post video, image or text content either to their own profile or to groups. 

Each post has upvotes and downvotes as well as a reply section. Each user has a limit of 10 votes per post, since each piece of content can be voted on multiple times. Everyone has a curated content feed with posts from their followed users and groups, as well as recommended content. Each user has friends and followers, as well as a private profile (only visible to friends) and a public profile (visible to everyone). Profiles can have many different channels where content is posted, with all posts aggregated together in the main feed.

Groups also consist of channels, including a main channel, each containing a section for posts and chats. Groups themselves can be part of larger groups in a nested structure. 

Users can chat privately with their friends or publicly in groups. Multiple chats can be made between the same users.

Currently contains a small content database for testing, this is temporary.

Still very early on so lots of features to add and bugs to fix!
